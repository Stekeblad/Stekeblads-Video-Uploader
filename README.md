# Stekeblad's Video Uploader

## Easier bulk uploads to YouTube
Helps people who upload a lot of videos to YouTube by automatically
setting video title, description, tags, playlist,
category, ... the user saves a lot of monotone work.

With Stekeblad's Video Uploader you can first create a "preset"
that is a predefined and reusable set of video details, like the default
tags/description feature on youtube, but with more settings and you can create several of them.
After that you select the files to upload, a preset to apply and press upload.
Now you just need to wait for the uploads to finish. No more editing the
video details for all videos one at a time on Youtube's upload page!

(You can still edit the videos one at a time if you want to)
